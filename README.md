🌱 Plant Disease Detection using Deep Learning
This project is an AI-powered system for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the PlantVillage Dataset to classify various plant diseases with high accuracy.

📌 Features
✅ Trained using TensorFlow/Keras
✅ Uses CNN-based image classification
✅ Supports multiple plant species & diseases
✅ Real-time prediction using uploaded images
✅ Model saved in .keras format
